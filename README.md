# ðŸ““ Notion Terminal Query Suite

A personalized suite of terminal-based scripts designed to query and display data from my Notion databases. This project showcases how to interact with Notion's API to retrieve and present information in a terminal environment.

## Overview
This suite includes scripts that:
- Query a Notion database containing football match schedules for my favorite teams and display their upcoming matches.
- Retrieve school assignments from a Notion database, filtering by class and due dates, and display them in a structured format.


## Features
- **Interactive Selection:** Utilize `fzf` for fuzzy finding to select databases and specific queries.
- **Dynamic Queries:** Scripts can filter data based on user input, such as selecting a specific football team or academic class.
- **Terminal-Friendly Display:** Data is presented in the terminal using `tabulate` for clear and organized output.
- **Status Highlighting:** Assignment statuses are color-coded for quick identification.

## ðŸš§ Not a Plug-and-Play Tool

This project is intended as a **personal CLI interface** for querying my own Notion databases â€” including upcoming football matches and school assignments.

The structure, filters, and queries are built specifically for my Notion setup. While you're welcome to browse the code and draw inspiration, youâ€™ll need to:

- Replace the Notion database IDs with your own
- Customize filters based on your schema
- Modify or extend the FZF menu for your use cases
